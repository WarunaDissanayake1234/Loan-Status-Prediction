# Loan Status Prediction Model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the status of loan applications using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Overview

This project implements a predictive model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify loan applications into different statuses. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Loan-Status-Prediction-Model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the SVM model, and predict the loan statuses.

## Files

- `loan_status_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the loan status prediction model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises various features related to loan applications, aiming to predict the status (approved or rejected) of the loan based on these features.
